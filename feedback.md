Overall Assessment: 4.5/5

Additional Comments: 

Great job all around. I don't have much constructive feedback. I'd change the `author.write` and `book.write` methods to `author.writes` and `book.writes` to indicate that the return value will be multiple instances of `write`. Could also just name the class `AuthorBook` if `writes` sounds really weird and confusing for a method name.
